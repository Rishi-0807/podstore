        I’ve been using the modified iPod daily for a few weeks now. Storage
        upgrade is stable and battery life is excellent. Everything was clearly
        explained before purchase and there were no surprises.

        Gave my old iPod for battery replacement and general service. Work was
        done neatly and the device performance has improved a lot. Syncing and
        playback are smooth now. Very satisfied.

        Bought a storage-modified iPod Classic. Sound quality is same as original
        which mattered to me. Battery backup is excellent and delivery was on
        time.
