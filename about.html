      <p>
        PodStore Electronics began with a simple love for music and classic iPods.
        What started as restoring old devices soon became a passion for bringing
        them back to life with better reliability and modern upgrades.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each iPod we work on is carefully rebuilt, tested, and refined so it can
        be enjoyed again the way it was meant to be — focused, reliable, and
        distraction-free.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based in Chennai, PodStore Electronics focuses on quality craftsmanship,
        honest pricing, and attention to detail. We believe vintage devices
        deserve care, not shortcuts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every build reflects our commitment to sound, durability, and trust.
      </p>
